# EXAM: Java Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
 - You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
 - Instead of copy-pasting your answers and solutions, write them in your own words.

# Tasks
## 1. Setup a new project (~5 mins) [5p]
- Create a new project inside your cloned repository
- Setup `.gitignore` file to exclude the IDE's generated files
    - Just the src directory should be committed
- Create a package called `com.greenfox.exams.java` and work under that

## 2. The BlackJack Application (~90 mins) [15p]
The task is to create a `BlackJack` application where a `user` `Player` can play BlackJack with the `house` `Player`. The game should have a very simple graphical user interface with two labels (one for the user and one for the house) and two buttons for draw and for resetting the game.

![Start](bj_start.png)

When a new game started a new `Deck` should be generated with 52 randomly ordered `Card`s in it.
When the user hits the `drawCard` button the top card of the deck should be added to the users `played` cards. If the house's played cards sum is under 17 it will draw automatically. After drawing the labels should be updated.

One card drawn:

![Round one](bj_1.png)

Two cards drawn:

![Round two](bj_2.png)

**Layout is not important just put everything in one JPanel with the default layout (no need to change that)**

When the user hits the `reset` button, a new Deck should be generated and players should be reset as well.

### Information on the elements
- Tests will be run on your code
    - use names in the code whats used in the description
    - don't use visibility on fields
    - don't use accent in strings or in comments
    - otherwise tests will fail probably
- The `BlackJack`
    - should be a `JPanel`
    - should have two buttons, a `user` and a `house` `Player`s and a `deck`
    - should handle the button actions in one method
- The `Deck`
    - should contain two lists: `cards` and `used`, all cards should be in the cards list and after used it should go in to the used list.
    - you can use the `Collection.shuffle(list)` for shuffling the deck
    - if all cards are used `null` should be returned when drawing from the deck
- The `Card`
    - should have a color and a value
    - should have a getter for the value
    - should be displayed as `"color value"` eg. `"karo 7"`
- The `Player`
    - should have a name
    - should have a list where it stores its `played` cards
    - should be able to `sum` the value of its played cards
    - should be able to `add` a new card to its played cards
    - should be added to the panel and displayed as shown: `"Name played: color value..."` eg. `"User played: kor 7 karo 4 "`
- In your main method
    - create a JFrame
    - add BlackJack panel to it
    - make it visible

### Acceptance criteria
The application is accepted if:
- All tests pass
- You can check your results here: http://gf-exam.mobil.ninja/
    - In order to register your work you have to create a Pull Request on Github
    - Go to your forked repo (https://github.com/yourname/zerda-java-basics)
    - Click `New pull request`
    - Then `Create pull request`
    - After the pull request created your every commit will be evaluated on the site
    - You can check your results

## 3. Understand the code (~10 mins) [4p]
```java
class Apple {
  public int add(int a, int b) {
    return 5;
  }

  public int max_of_three(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a > b) {
      return a;
    }
    return c;
  }
}

class TestApple {
  public void testAdd() {
    assertEquals(5, Apple.add(2, 3));
  }

  public void testMax() {
    assertEquals(5, Apple.max_of_three(3, 4, 5));
  }
}
```
